# `jlox`
Implementation of the Lox language in Java, from the book [Crafting Interpreters](http://craftinginterpreters.com/).

This version of the Lox language is a naive tree-walker interpreter, with the following features:
* tokens and lexing
* recursive descent parsing
* prefix and infix expressions
* interpreting code using the Visitor pattern
* lexical scope
* environment chains for storing variables
* control flow and iteration
* first class functions and classes
* closures
* static variable resolution and error detection
* class with constructor, methods, and fields
* class inheritance
